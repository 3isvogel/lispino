> Reproducing tinylisp to integrate it with the [vulkan-sandbox](https://github.com/3isvogel/vulkan-sandbox) later

As for the other projects, the resources used are grouped on [the Easy Blog](https://3isvogel.github.io/blogs/#lisp-machine), the main programming language will probably be **C** or, if I get tired, **C++**

  - [Building project](#building-project)

## Building project

Use `make` because I dont't want to write shell scripts and please don't make me learn CMake
```sh
make
```

Alternatively just build and run the project from make
```sh
make run
```

Also **PLEASE** use `-j<N>` when building, I put so much effort into making projects working fine with it
